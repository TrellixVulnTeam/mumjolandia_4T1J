- now
    - tests for fat mode and classes
    - should supervisor get via command task object, or everything to create it by itself?
    - check if enums ids in factories are correct in db
    - should i refactor messages to ['task add', 'success']
    - refactor loaders to have common interface

- mumjolandia
    - what happens when I run the application twice at the same time?
    - every mumjolandia operation should return exit status up to dataPasser - should return to cli/gui
    - add task generator to generate task occurrences by scheme (weekly/daily/etc)
    - change xml for tasks: <task name='xD'><description>des</description><date>26.09.2018</date></task>
    - add options to fully config things (save to xml/pickle, gui/cli, debug level, etc) should it be xml? or sth else?
    - consider making mumjolandia supervisor a singleton
    - set mode to skip first part of command
    - open port to allow communication from different applications

- random
    - investigate enums to not allow values not included in them to be passed etc (some article in www)
    - change encoding in xml files to get rif of '&#263' chars

- food
    - add quality sql errors handling
    - refactor to be more readable

- sql
    - check if connection to database is successful
    - check if sql enums are correct with db (or add mechanism to create them based on db)

- games
    - function to add games to db quickly


parowy/bugi:
    - add preparing food command in cli (don't let 'food print xD' (exception 'sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column') to be passed)
    - cli exits when it spots a string - implement queue for cli that supervisor will put exit command in and then it will exit
    -"task add 'xD 'hombre'" - no space between words
