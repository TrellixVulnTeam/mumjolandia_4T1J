- chyba jest zla scierzka mumjolandi jak sie wystartuje skrypt z innego folderu niz z mainem
- MumjolandiaCli.__prepare_command needs refactor badly :(
- Event - add fixed type to code and xml


- random
    - refactor loaders to have common interface
    - config_loader should check if values are correct

- mumjolandia
    - cli doesn't need to change input like 'i' -> ingredients' - it is better to make multiple commands in supervisors
    (currently i -> ingredients is implemented in foodsupervisor; do the same with rest
    - what happens when I run the application twice at the same time?
    - every mumjolandia operation should return exit status up to dataPasser - should return to cli/gui
    - add task generator to generate task occurrences by scheme (weekly/daily/etc)
    - change xml for tasks: <task name='xD'><description>des</description><date>26.09.2018</date></task>
    - add options to fully config things (save to xml/pickle, gui/cli, debug level, etc) should it be xml? or sth else?
    - consider making mumjolandia supervisor a singleton
    - set mode to skip first part of command
    - open port to allow communication from different applications

- random
    - investigate enums to not allow values not included in them to be passed etc (some article in www)
    - change encoding in xml files to get rif of '&#263' chars

- food
    - mealFactory should use 'isinstance', but i am not sure if it wont break save/load to db
    - add quality sql errors handling
    - refactor to be more readable



parowy/bugi:
    - no tests fot 'set' command in TaskSupervisor
    - task_supervisor::__command_set should use method task_supervisor::edit_task to save task (now calls __save_task by itself)
    - add preparing food command in cli (don't let 'food print xD' (exception 'sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column') to be passed)
    -"task add 'xD 'hombre'" - no space between words
    - cli 'prepare command' and 'shortcut generator' should be refactored
    -'task undone xx0' - exception when parameter is NaN
